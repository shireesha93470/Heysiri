In my group I like one person  if I am stuck in anything she is always supporting me. If I feel bad she said don’t think too much. All will be ok soon .Not only professional in personal life but she supports me a lot . she guides me what is wrong what is right if i made any mistake she corrects my mistake she has so much patience sometimes i took wrong decisions that time she is correcting that mistakes.she teaches me how to work on a team.she takes care me very much.


In my team I don’t like one person   she always thinks her point of view is correct.if she made any mistake she shouted a lot and she controles opposite persons.she needs any help that time she is acting like a good person and praising other people.In remaining things she is good she is helping to group members.if someone is striking in somewhere in coding she is helping to us.


"I really admire a person in my group because she's always there for me when I need help. She's supportive and tells me not to overthink things, assuring me that everything will be okay. She not only helps me professionally but also supports me in my personal life. She guides me, corrects my mistakes, and shows a lot of patience. Whenever I make wrong decisions, she helps me correct them. She's also teaching me how to work effectively in a team, and she takes good care of me."

I dislike one person in my team because she is always convinced that her opinions are the only correct ones. Whenever she makes a mistake, she tends to shout and tries to control others. However, when she needs help, she acts friendly and praises others. On the positive side, she does help other group members and is supportive when someone is struggling with coding



2.  Why do u think trust is more important to build team?share your observation? 
     TEAM means Together everyone achives more.In a team trust is more important because without trust ,we can't build a strong team.Understanding,relationship and openmind are important in a team.if we trust someone we should feel comfortable to  share our personal thoughts with them .they did any mistake we shoulg give constructive feedback to help them.without trust we won't share anything with team members.After completing my degree i joined in jtbb team.From starting there was no trust in our group.every time all members are fighting.we didn't understand each other and didn't take responsibility.so there was not trust in our team.after one month  we started to understand each other and all team members taking resposibity.now we should understand trust is more important in team.if we can trust each other we can take decisions together.Ego and Jealous are main obstacles of team building.In starting Ego and Jealous were not built trust in our team.Now there is no ego and jealous so we are trusting each other. 
     
     
     "TEAM means Together Everyone Achieves More. In a team, trust is more important because without trust, we can't build a strong team. Understanding, healthy relationships, and open-mindedness are also essential in a team. If we trust someone, we should feel comfortable sharing our personal thoughts and experiences with them. If they make a mistake, we should provide constructive feedback to help them improve. Without trust, team members won't feel safe to share and collaborate effectively.

After completing my degree, I joined the JTBB team. Initially, there was no trust within our group, and conflicts arose frequently. We didn't understand each other and avoided taking responsibility, which hindered trust within the team. However, after about a month, we started to understand each other better, and all team members began taking responsibility for their actions. As a result, trust started to develop among us. Now, we realize the importance of trust in our team, as it enables us to make decisions together.

Ego and jealousy are the main obstacles to team building. At the beginning, ego and jealousy prevented the development of trust within our team. However, we have worked on resolving these issues, and now there is no ego or jealousy among us, which has significantly improved our trust in each other."

	When I was studying 2 units at Masai School, we had a project last week with a one-week deadline. Unfortunately, I didn't have much time to work on it, as they gave us a very tight deadline. In the first three days, I wasted time dealing with some other work, leaving only four days to complete the project.

During those four days, I faced significant difficulties in completing the project. To meet the deadline, I had to work until 4 or 5 am every morning. Somehow, I managed to complete both the project and the evaluation preparation within that limited time. It was indeed a challenging deadline for me.
